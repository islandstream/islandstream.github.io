Connections between growing and heritage in diverse communities

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mindmap-guardians-of-connected-seeds.jpg)

My questions:
- How does produce get distributed so that it is not wasted? How could these systems be scaled up so that people are growing collaboratively, in a way that provides for the wider community and not just those that are directly envolved in the endeavour? 
- This type of initiative is dependent on collaboration between a highly diverse and distinct set of experts. The home-growers and the technicians. Is there an opportunity to bridge this gap? Do you see vertical farming as having any place in a traditional soil based system of horticulture?
- Could sensors be used to assist busy, people that have the ideology and money to spend on setting up growing spaces but not always the time?
