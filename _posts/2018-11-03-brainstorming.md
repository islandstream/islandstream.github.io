title: Group post-up and brainstorming session

During our post-up session Team Sex and the Smart City ideated using timed brainstorms.  My contributions came from reading, research, observations and experience as a (not very active) member of a 
community garden plot, and from thinking about the barriers and issues around co-ordinated efforts to grow food in an urban 
community in South East London.
