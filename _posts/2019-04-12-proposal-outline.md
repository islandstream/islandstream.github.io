**Working Title:** Designing data explorations for visitor engagement and sustainable practices with community gardens.  

## Research question 1
How might one design a tool or a collection of tools that supports situated digital data collection in an urban farm or community space? 

## Research Question 2
How successful are the interventions in fostering visitor enagement, raising local awareness of sustainable development goals and increasing visitor numbers?  

## The problem space (e.g. what are you trying to do and why and how):
Spitalfields City Farm is a charity and as such is required to demonstrate ROI to funders. The management and operations team do not have the time or money to invest in new systems for data capture and struggle to make effective use of the farm data they have access to.  I would like to investigate creative ways of bridging the data gaps in this and potentially other community care farms and agricultural spaces by designing tools and signage to aid digital data collection, foster visitor enagagement and raise local awareness of sustainable development goals. This is important because in so doing, the farm will be better equipped and informed of the tangible benefit they provide to the community and will be in a better position to collaborate and connect with other enterprises through knowledge sharing and improved visibility. I would like to do this by firstly designing and testing a range of survey questions targetted at either staff or visitors. The simple survey questions would be placed around the farm and accessible via QR codes. Staff would be able to record tasks that they have completed and visitors would be able to describe their experiences and motivations as they navigate the farm. Examples of incentives for completing the surveys might be that visitors would be able to download a recipe or enter a photo they have taken at the farm, into a competition. Secondly I would like to design and test an icon based user interface to ensure this tool is accessible to low literacy users. Thirdly I would like to test the physical properties and resilience of materials used for the signage to see how well they weather and what textures or sizes of materials users find most appealing.
