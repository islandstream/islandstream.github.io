The DataWeave (named plotweave for the event) is a rudimentary attempt at providing feedback for urban agricultural plots. Urban farms are popular places to visit as educational spaces but how could they adapt to become part of a broader solution? And how would adapting affect them?

It makes sense that high yield food production should happen close to point of consumption. It’s already happening with vertical farming using hydro or aeroponic systems. But this is being done by big businesses such as Phillips, for smaller businesses such as restaurants. These technologies haven’t yet found a place in urban gardens and spaces because they serve very different purposes however we learnt that there is a place for tech in farms, but in the nooks & crannies. It is not a cure-all as with anything, but by understanding more about local history, community engagement and what it’s like to manage an urban farm we came away with a set of methods that opened us to a richer understanding of what a resource like Spitalfields Farm means to locals. 

Danielle Albers Szafir noted recently in IX magazine that flashy visualisations are not always optimized to help people see what matters. Our artefact is of questionable statistical use. It is, by nature woolly. Szafirs plea is for the data scientist or designer to honor clarity and truth through well designed visualisations, however it is also relevant to our tapestry. It’s rough, raw, unpolished and slow to render. What matters in our data physicalisation is what was learned in the process, the fabric created, the people, the heritage of the crafts and the collective experience and skill of the communities that use them, and not excluding otherwise marginalised folk, the elderly, the technophobic, or people far from home. By creating an object that people can interact with in it’s making and it’s telling, we hope to find ways that HCI can enrich conversations about community and sustainability in urban community farms and gardens.  


The final chapter for our tapestry will be that it goes to live on the farm, among the posters, displays and artefacts from other projects and initiatives. There is some work still to be done to rethread the loom that we used, to make it ready for the next people. We are also looking at databases to leverage QR codes for crops at the farm and we will share what we have learned about generating codes so that the farm can start using these to manage their catalogue of native, exotic and heritage crops and share information about them with visitors. We could imagine a future world where urban farms are not only educational, vitalising spaces but places where food production and distribution can become a coordinated effort such that we can grow cottage industries in the heart of our cities, to grow food locally, improve air quality through reduced transport of food, improved health and well-being through skill sharing and ensure a fairer distribution of fresh, affordable organic food.
