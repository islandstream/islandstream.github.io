title: Plot Weave

**The DataWeave (named plotweave for the event) is a rudimentary attempt at providing feedback for urban agricultural plots.** Urban farms are popular places to visit as educational spaces but how could they adapt to become part of a broader solution? And how would adapting affect them? [Annotations]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/craft-data-vis.png "Annotation. Please use browser back button to escape")

It makes sense that high yield food production should happen close to point of consumption. It’s already happening with vertical farming using hydro or aeroponic systems. But this is being done by big businesses such as Phillips, for smaller businesses such as restaurants. These technologies haven’t yet found a place in urban gardens and spaces because they serve very different purposes however we learnt that there is a place for tech in farms, but in the nooks & crannies. It is not a cure-all as with anything, but **by understanding more about local history, community engagement and what it’s like to manage an urban farm we came away with a set of methods that opened us to a richer understanding of what a resource like Spitalfields Farm is already doing** and in knowing this we wold better better equipped to design smart and sensitive solutions. 

Danielle Albers Szafir noted recently in IX magazine that **flashy visualisations are not always optimized to help people see what matters.** Our artefact is of questionable statistical use. It is, by nature woolly. Szafirs plea is for the data scientist or designer to honor clarity and truth through well designed visualisations, however it is also relevant to our tapestry. It’s rough, raw, unpolished and slow to render. What matters in our data physicalisation is what was learned in the process, the fabric created, the people, the heritage of the crafts and the collective experience and skill of the communities that use them, and not excluding marginalised or technophobic folk.

> By creating an object that people can interact with in it’s making and it’s telling, we hope to find ways that HCI can enrich conversations about community and sustainability in urban community farms and gardens.
