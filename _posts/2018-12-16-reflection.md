The final chapter for our tapestry will be that it goes to live on the farm, among the posters, displays and artefacts from other projects and initiatives. There is some work still to be done to rethread the loom that we used, to make it ready for the next people. We are also looking at databases to leverage QR codes for crops at the farm and we will share what we have learned about generating codes so that the farm can start using these to manage their catalogue of native, exotic and heritage crops and share information about them with visitors.

We could imagine a future world where urban farms are not only educational, vitalising spaces but places where food production and distribution can become a coordinated effort such that we can grow cottage industries in the heart of our cities, to grow food locally, improve air quality through reduced transport of food, improved health and well-being through skill sharing and ensure a fairer distribution of fresh, affordable organic food.
