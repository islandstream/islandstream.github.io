Starting to think about sensors in the city, especially in terms of pollution. How can we make life in the city safer, cleaner and more human? As 'Living Sensors' we filter much of what we percieve to protect ourselves from information overload but as environmental sensors, absorbing and reacting to pollution such as sound, light and particulates, we have zero control. How can we better protect ourselves as we move about the crowded city?
