title: Coproduction: Permaculture and sensing technologies
---

Farming and agriculture have always been drivers of technological innovation. It is here we see hybrid solutions of interaction with technology 
being the means by which humans exploit non-human life. I would like to be able to explore how cultivation in an urban 
setting would encapsulate coproduction. The essence of Permaculture is biodiversity. The essence and life-blood of cities are 
thier cultural diversity. How do we support this and how does technology play a part?
