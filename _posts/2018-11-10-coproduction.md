title: Coproduction, permaculture and sensing technologies
---

Farming and agriculture have always been drivers of technological innovation. It is here we see hybrid solutions of interaction with technology. I would like to explore how crop cultivation in an urban setting might fulfill Rosner's notion of coproduction by means of provocation, rather than presentation of an all singing, all dancing solution.

> With the continual intertwining of nature and artifice questions
concerning the role of digital technology in previously
non-digital domains not only prove critical to theorizing the
human-machine interface, but also offer a means of designing
otherwise—in locations and moments of collective
work that address a wider arrangement of humans and technology.
Focusing on craft, we have seen how the alternative
metaphor of coproductions may animate new possibilities
for design like considering environments as makers, collective
(human and nonhuman) experiences, ephemeral forms,
and resituated histories. So doing, we join broader calls to
diversify hybrid territories (e.g. [11,19,23,29,34]), acknowledging
how all formulations give way to wider sets of
actors and arrangements. What is being “tinkered” with in
these alternative formulations is not just stuff, but also
selves, relationships, collectives and cultures.
