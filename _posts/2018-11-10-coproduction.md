title: Coproduction, permaculture and sensing technologies
---

Farming and agriculture have always been drivers of technological innovation. It is here we see hybrid solutions of interaction with technology. I would like to explore how crop cultivation in an urban setting might fulfill Rosner's notion of coproduction by means of provocation, rather than presentation of an all singing, all dancing solution.

> The strength of coproductions as a metaphor is its ability to expand and
sensitize designers to a different set of phenomena in the
world. These sensitivities could ultimately lead to more
traditionally “useful” designs that suggest compelling alternative
interactions in a vibrant world of people and things
