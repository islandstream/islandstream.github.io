Planning, logisitics, and building prototypes.

Looking at the work of Bauhaus visual artist Anni Albers at the recent exhibition in the Tate Modern, helped the group to understand how to plan a woven design.

Situating our ideas amoung projects that have already been brought to life. [Enlarge]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/data-collection.png)

Knowing what the parts of the loom were called helped us understand the tool and helped us engage with visitors.

Sketching the weave helped with hand-eye coordination on the day and helped get to grips with the binary nature of the process.

Using the a 3D printer to make prototypes, I learnt how to source and manipulate 3D plans using Cura and Ultimaker2. [Annotations]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/print3d-annotate.png)

We used colour theory to code the stratified visitor data by using 1:1 warp/weft pattern. For simplicity and to improve the readability of the weave we chose this over a more complex grid pattern.

To mock up our 'future vision' I code-scraped a page of the gov.uk website using node and hosted it on github pages inorder to generate a QR code from an online generator, ahead of the event.
