title: Wesley Willets Situated and Embedded Visualization
---

Wesley Willets seminar on situated and embedded visualisation included a broad sweep of the state of the art and an overview 
of two studies he is conducting. One into the use of low energy, bluetooth enabled tags as situated data collection devices and another into the impact of scale on 3D data visualizations handled by human participants in a VR environment 
[Immersive Analytics](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/vishub/immersiveanalytics/).
