title: Wesley Willets Situated and Embedded Visualization
---

Wesley Willets seminar on situated and embedded visualisation included a broad sweep of the state of the art and an overview 
of two studies he is conducting. One into the use of low energy, bluetooth enabled tags as situated data collection devices and another into the impact of scale on 3D data visualizations handled by human participants in a VR environment 
[Immersive Analytics](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/vishub/immersiveanalytics/).

### Situated data visualisations can take many forms including:
* AR for business and travel reviews
* street level overlays/projections
* use in warehouses to create data responsive objects or shelving systems

### Willets is proposing a framework for situated data visualisation
* Blending of Logic and physical world; 
* Flow of information from raw data into the data viz pipeline, the physical presentation and the physical referent;

### Types of situated visualisation:
* Non-situated (e.g. traditional PC based visualisations)
* Situated (e.g touchscreens/printed paper)
* Embedded (tightly integrated subclass of situated)
