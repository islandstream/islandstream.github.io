"Pushing down the weft". There are no shortcuts to weaving. One has to push down the weft one row at a time. **If you try and do two rows the warp and weft lock together and it becomes impossible to move the beater**.

**"Net Promoter Score"** Visitors were asked to weave their responses on the Net Promoter Score device (aka printed hand loom).

**Whole Earth Book** I found 3 pages dedicated to weaving in my original Whole Earth Catalogue (1981) and brought this along as a reference guide for visitors to browse. ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/whole-earth-book.png "'The Next' Whole Earth Book")
