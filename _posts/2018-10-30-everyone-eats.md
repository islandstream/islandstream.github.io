A key facet of a closed-loop, transparent food source would be that food production should be local 
and accessible to the local population of a city or urban environment, where resource is scarce and/or in high demand. 

This means bringing food production and the handling of food waste / recycling of products and 
equipment into the bounds of the city. It also raises questions about who would be the best 
custodians of a system like this.

The current system is created, propagated and maintained by a broken and top-heavy, linear systems of food production, the smallest output of which is the food on our tables. Large, global, profit-focused companies can hide their wasteful habits in an inefficient chain of production, to get their product to market. In doing so they literally kick the can 
down the road. I would like our solution to be one that removes or disrupts some of this power or at the very least offers a way to improve the inefficiencies of the current system. The problem I have with the latter approach is that we are layering on incongruencies and complexity onto buisness models which are driven by sector dominance and muscle power in which baseline profit are the primry drivers of invention, over sustainability and human dignity or well-being.

What if we started to imagine introducing technology to a pre-industrial supply chain. What things could be introduced to support growers and consumers, and only reintroducing the market place the very last stage, when all other avenues for food distribution have been exhausted? 

How might the players in a devolved system be categorised?

- People who currently grow their own food

- People who want to grow their own food but canâ€™t 

- People who have no interest in growing their own food 

Is it possible to design a system or service that provides for each of these sets of people in a way 
that is fair, high-impact, high-yield, low-risk, clean, well organised and reliable?
