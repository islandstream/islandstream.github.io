Everyone eats!

A key facet of a closed-loop, transparent food source would be that food production should be local 
and accessible to the local population or a city or urban environment. 

This means bringing food production and the handling of food waste / recycling of products and 
equipment into the bounds of the city. It also raises questions about who would be the best 
guardians or providers of a system like this?

When a large part of the problem with the current system is created, propagated and maintained by 
large, global, profit-focused companies who hide their wasteful habits, literally kick the can 
down the road, it’s tempting to think about a new system being one that removes or disrupts some of 
this power. 

A nice exercise might be to imagine introducing technology to a pre-industrial supply chain. 
What things could be introduced to support growers and consumers, and only reintroducing the 
market place the very last stage, when all other avenues for food distribution have been exhausted? 

How might the players in a devolved system be categorised?

- People who currently grow their own food

- People who want to grow their own food but can’t 

- People who have no interest in growing their own food 

Is it possible to design a system or service that provides for each of these sets of people in a way 
that is fair, high-impact, high-yield, low-risk, clean, well organised and reliable?
