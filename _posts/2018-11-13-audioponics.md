Inspired by the ethnographic study Sara Heitlinger did at City Farm, I introduce Audioponics: A system of plant cultivation that bathes plants and their root system in sound to stimulate growth.

This could be looked as a **craft-based coproduction with a possibility of layering on a camera for hyper-spectral imaging to communicate plant health, to enable communication of visual and auditory states of being**.
