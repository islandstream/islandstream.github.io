Title: Capturing the City
---
Week 3

## Museum of london visit

### Thoughts
* How do sound, light and time interplay? 
* Soundtraps (audio sensors placed around the city capturing changes in activity, incidental interval noise)
* Twinning towns and villages through sound. Swapping sounds from different types of places. 
* Piped birdsong. Phonograph
* Noise cancelling sound bars
