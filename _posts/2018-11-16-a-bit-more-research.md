The unit consists of three parts: an area for activities related to nature and agriculture, an area for community gardening, an ‘AgroLab’ specialising in experimenting with intensive organic agricultural production. All three areas are made up of cultivable land and will include: an experimental urban agricultural farm, a shared garden for residents of the neighbourhood, an educational garden, a shared greenhouse for plants and seedlings, equipment for collecting rainwater, phytopurification, solar energy and biogas, aquaponics crops, agricultural short circuits, etc. The buildings will include prototypes of organic intensive farming and a range of equipment and know-how covering: a seed library, a vegetable market and local agricultural products, collective Café and cooking facility, a collective bread oven" %}
