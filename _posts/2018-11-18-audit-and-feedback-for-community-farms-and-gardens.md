Despite being situated next to a very busy road, the physical characteristics of the walled garden (having a physical barrier on the polluted side) and it's position (next to a school) can mitigate against exposeure and dramatically reduce the presence of airbourne particulates in these locations, and that garden spaces act as a green lung.  How can the natural sensing properties of plants be leveraged in the city and by smart tech to show us where the air is cleaner?" %}
