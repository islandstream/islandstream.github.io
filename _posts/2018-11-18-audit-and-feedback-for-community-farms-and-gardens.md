title: Audit and Feedback for Community Farms and Gardens

Starting to think about ways data can inhabit and complement existing community garden spaces.

In Lara Houstens seminar talk on Citizen Sense she describes how sensors tied to trees in an urban community garden in Deptford revealed surprising results. Despite being situated next to a very busy road, the physical characteristics of the walled garden (having a physical barrier on the polluted side) and it's position (next to a school) can mitigate against exposeure and dramatically reduce the presence of airbourne particulates in these locations, and that garden spaces act as a green lung.  How can the natural sensing properties of plants be leveraged in the city and by smart tech to show us where the air is cleaner?

Gather ideas for 'soft sensor' / qualitative data points. I'm interested in investigating the 'soft' side of sensors. Living sensors, interpretive and qualitative indicators over quantitative data

Clay maquettes. We used 3D materials to bring our sketches to life and imagine their 360 form
