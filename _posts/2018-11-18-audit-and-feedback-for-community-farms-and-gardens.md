title: Audit and Feedback for Community Farms and Gardens

Starting to think about ways data can inhabit and complement existing community garden spaces.

**Moss as a bio indicator to pollution**

In Lara Houstens talk on Citizen Sense she describes how sensors, tied to trees in an urban community garden in Deptford, revealed surprising results. Despite being situated next to a very busy road, the physical characteristics of the walled garden (having a physical barrier on the polluted side) and it's position (next to a school) can mitigate against exposeure and dramatically reduce the presence of airbourne particulates in these locations, and that **garden spaces act as a green lung.**  How can the natural sensing properties of plants be leveraged in the city and by smart tech to show us where the air is cleaner?


Gather ideas for 'soft sensor' / qualitative data points. I'm interested in investigating the 'soft' side of sensors. Living sensors, interpretive and qualitative indicators over quantitative data.


**3D cartography**. Sketch of a 3D data viz for a map plotting existing community gardens in London. Data points to include facilities and features such as air quality, produce, livestock, toilets, cafe.
