title: Fleshing out ideas
---

During our post-up session we ideated using timed brainstorms. The following ideas came about from my reading, research, observations, experience as a (not very active) member of a 
community garden plot and thinking about all the barriers and issues around co-ordinated efforts to grow food in an urban 
community in South East London.
