Currently studying an MSc in HCID and working as a Researcher in HCI at City University of London where I'm getting to practice my UCD interview skills whilst building the front-end for an online experiment called ENACT. 

### At work
My work currently involves travelling around the country chatting to nurses and doctors about their experiences using audit reports, infographics and how discover how they feel about the work of Philip Glass. After experiencing the joys and intensity of human interaction, the next stage is undertaking a thorough theme analysis of the data captured in the design/test sessions. This inevitably leads to physiological symtoms including eye-bag and hunchback but culminates in user-centred prototyping at which point I can walk again in the sunsine, hear the birds sing, and smile with impunity at all of humankind. 

### At school
I'm taking Creativity in Design where I get to play with sketch books and tell myself that Art degree I got was the Best Career Move Ever. It's also given me a kick to get back involved with my Jekyll blog which I started and didn't finish. I will over the coming weeks brush-up on markdown and scss as I furnish it with INM391 goodness, sketches and annotations. 

Personal recent projects incude a reskin of the realjunkfoodproject.com website.
