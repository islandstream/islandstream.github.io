Currently studying HCID and working as a Researcher in HCI at City University of London. I'm getting to practice my UCD interview skills whilst building the front-end for an experiment.  

### More Information
At school I'm taking Creativity in Design where I get to play with sketch books and which gave me a kick to get back involved with this Jekyll blog I started ages ago. Personal recent projects incude a reskin of the realjunkfoodproject.com website.
