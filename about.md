Currently studying an MSc in HCID and working as a Researcher in HCI at City University of London where I'm getting to practice my UCD skills whilst building the front-end for an online experiment called ENACT. 

### At work
My work involves travelling around the country chatting to nurses and doctors about their experiences using audit reports, infographics and (occassionally) how they feel about the work of Philip Glass. 

### At school
I'm taking Creativity in Design where I get to play with sketchbooks and tell myself the Art degree I got was the Best Career Move Ever. It's also given me a kick to get back involved with my Jekyll blog which I will, over the coming weeks, furnish with INM391 related ideas, sketches and annotations while brushing-up on some markdown and scss. 

Personal recent projects incude a reskin of the realjunkfoodproject.com website.
