Currently studying an MSc in HCID and working as a Researcher in HCI at City University of London where I'm getting to practice my UCD interview skills whilst building the front-end for an online experiment called ENACT. 

### At work
My work currently involves travelling around the country chatting to nurses and doctors about their experiences using audit reports, infographics and (occassionally) how they feel about the work of Philip Glass. After experiencing the joys and intensity of human interaction, the next stage involves a rather dry and exacting theme analysis of the data, culminating in a user-centred prototype.  At which point I can walk again in the sunsine, hear the birds sing, and smile with impunity at all of humankind. 

### At school
I'm taking Creativity in Design where I get to play with sketchbooks and tell myself the Art degree I got was the Best Career Move Ever. It's also given me a kick to get back involved with my Jekyll blog which I will over the coming weeks furnish with INM391 goodness, sketches and annotations as I brush-up on some markdown and scss. 

Personal recent projects incude a reskin of the realjunkfoodproject.com website.
