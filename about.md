Currently studying an MSc in HCID and working as a Researcher in HCI at City University of London where I'm getting to practice my UCD interview skills whilst building the front-end for an online experiment called ENACT. 

### At work
My work currently involves travelling around the country chatting to nurses and doctors about their experiences using audit reports, infographics and how they feel about the work of Philip Glass which makes me happy. Then I have to lock myself in a room to analyse/code it all which gives me eye-bags and a hunchback but then prototyping brings me much fun, and I can walk again in the sunsine, and hear the birds sing and smile with impunity at all of humankind. 

### At school
I'm taking Creativity in Design where I get to play with sketch books and think like I'm back at Art School. It's also given me a kick to get involved with this Jekyll blog I started over a year ago which I will over the coming weeks furnish with INM391 goodness, sketches and annotations. 

Personal recent projects incude a reskin of the realjunkfoodproject.com website.
